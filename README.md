# Tabula Via

Tabula Via is an Android app designed to help teachers track the progress of classroom assignments.

The project’s focus is to provide highly specific support, with no intention of becoming a general-purpose or widely used application. So, when I say “teachers,” I really mean “myself.” :simple_smile:

## Description

The Tabula Via application is a comprehensive educational tool designed to assist teachers in managing their classes and activities. It empowers educators to:

- Manage Courses: Teachers can create new courses, specifying details such as the course name, academic year, and period. They can view a list of all their created courses and select one to access its specific dashboard, which serves as a central hub for that course.
- Manage Students: Within each course, teachers can add students individually or import multiple students in bulk. For each student, they can view a detailed profile, including their display name and student number. This allows for easy tracking and management of the student roster.
- Record Attendance: The application facilitates marking student attendance for class sessions. Teachers can create new attendance sessions, record each student's status (present, absent, late), and review past attendance records for individual students or the class as a whole.
- Organize Activities and Groups: Teachers can create various activities for their courses. For collaborative tasks, the system supports both random group generation (based on predefined criteria like number of groups or students per group) and manual group formation using an interactive drag-and-drop editor. Students can be moved between "unassigned" status, new groups, or existing groups.
- Assess Skills: The platform allows teachers to define a set of core skills for each course. During activities, teachers can assign skill assessments to individual students or to entire groups, recording their proficiency levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High). The application tracks these assessments, potentially showing trends in student skill development over time.
- Backup and Restore Data: All application data, including course details, student records, attendance, activities, groups, and skill assessments, can be securely backed up to and restored from cloud storage (Firebase). This ensures data safety and allows for seamless migration or recovery. 
- User Authentication: Teachers can securely access the application by signing in with their Google accounts, utilizing Firebase Authentication for user management.
