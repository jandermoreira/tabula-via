# Tabula Via

Tabula Via is an Android app designed to help teachers track the progress of classroom assignments.

The project’s focus is to provide highly specific support, with no intention of becoming a general-purpose or widely used application. So, when I say “teachers,” I really mean “myself.” :simple_smile:
